# RoadSceneï¼ša new dataset of aligned infrared and visible images

This datset has 221 aligned Vis and IR image pairs containing rich scenes such as roads, vehicles, pedestrians and so on. These images are highly repetitive scenes from the [FLIR video](https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/) with highly repetitive scenes.

Some typical examples are shown below:
